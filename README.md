# Chicago Car Crashes Prediction Project

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict the severity of car crashes in Chicago based on various factors such as weather conditions, road design, driver behavior, and time of day. The goal is to help the City of Chicago better anticipate accidents and implement preventive measures to reduce damage and improve safety.

### Business Problem
The City of Chicago is looking to predict the severity of future car crashes to allocate resources more effectively and take proactive actions to prevent accidents. By identifying high-risk situations, the city can reduce the impact of traffic accidents.

### Models Used
- **Model 1: Logistic Regression** (Baseline)
- **Model 2: Decision Trees** 
- **Model 3: Pipeline with StandardScaler and Logistic Regression** (Optimized)

### Best Model
The best model is **Pipeline with StandardScaler and Logistic Regression**, with an F1 score of `0.7636` and an accuracy of `89%`.
